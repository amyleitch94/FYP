# Blog: NFC-ATTENDENCE TRACKER

## Blog 06/02/2018

I have watched NFC tutorials online, and today I attempted to practice some of them as well as creating a base app to work with.
This led to me realising that the Android Emulator in Android does not support NFC and I needed to research alternatives.
OpenNFC sdk seems to be the only solution, but their website is down and I cannot find the correct download. I attempted to use my own phone but Developer settings are unavailable until I get hold of another phone. 

My aim for this week is to complete a base app with NFC functionality that can be tested using the emulator, and then tested on my own device with NFC tags I purchased.
